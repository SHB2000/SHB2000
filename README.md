Hello, I'm SHB2000, and I mainly use github for maps. You can find me on Wikimedia sites and more about me on <a>https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:SHB2000</a>

All my work can be used without my permission, under the CC BY-SA 3.0 AU license. A full list of what is bound by that license can be found at <a>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/au/</a>. Simply, all you need is to attribute myself. Even linking my project link is fine with me. If you're using this in a Wikimedia Project, just link the link in the edit summary, and that'll do fine.
